# bookbot

BookBot is a Python script that analyzes a text file (book) and generates a report on its contents. The script counts the total number of words and provides a character-by-character breakdown of the text, listing each character and its frequency. The character counts are sorted in descending order from most to least frequent.

To use the script, run python3 main.py <path to book> in your terminal, replacing <path to book> with the path to the text file you wish to analyze. For example: python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt.
